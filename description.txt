A Rod of Discord hotkey that doesn't suck.

A lot of hotkeys on the browser are either tacked onto an existing mod or get around replicating the Rod of Discord's code by making you equip and then use the item on the spot before swapping back to your old item. This is very finnicky and, if it messes up (say, if the item doesn't change back), can get you killed easily.

This was my huffy solution to that issue. RODHTDS's sole purpose (and none else!) is to provide a Rod of Discord hotkey that's safe, extremely lightweight, and balanced.

It comes with two hotkeys: Safe Teleport and Unsafe Teleport. Both serve the identical purpose of teleporting you to the cursor, using the exact same code used in the vanilla Rod of Discord, and inflicting Chaos State. Safe Teleport will only teleport you if you don't have Chaos State; it's thus spammable without fear of accidentally teleporting twice and dealing heavy damage! Unsafe Teleport will teleport regardless of Chaos State, possibly causing damage.

Both keys have a half-second cooldown (identical to vanilla RoD) both for balance and to prevent mashing Unsafe Teleport instantly killing you.
